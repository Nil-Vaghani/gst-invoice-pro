so i've some questions to ask
so run terminal commands and there i'll write my question. terminal should acccpet multiline input as well as should not has any error on taking special chars as a input.
after submitting my response only you should begin processing my question. your task is to analyse my query and process it in order to find it's answer.
remember to give not in terminal but in your chat.
then after completion of your answer, you'll again run terminal for my next question input.
one more thing to add is whenever i stop you from running any terminal command, then immediately run --> Read-Host "any updates?"  in terminal so that i can help you with your response.
we will repeat this process until i say "stop it" with the same case sensitivity on my response. let's start with the first question. hii, how are you?
